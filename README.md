# Project Description: Text Summarization with NLTK

## Overview:
The Text Summarization project aims to provide users with a tool to generate concise summaries of lengthy text documents. Leveraging Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques and the NLTK library, the application can process input text and extract key sentences to create a condensed version.

## Features:
1. **Input Text:** Users can input their text directly into the application.
2. **Summarization:** Upon user request, the application processes the text and generates a summary consisting of the most relevant sentences.
3. **Interactive Interface:** The user interface is intuitive and easy to use, allowing users to input text and view the generated summary effortlessly.

## Technologies Used:
- Python
- Streamlit
- NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit)
- Numpy
- Pandas
- NetworkX
- Scikit-learn

## Target Audience:
The target audience for this project includes students, researchers, professionals, and anyone who needs to quickly grasp the main points of lengthy texts without reading them in full.

## Objectives:
- Provide a simple and efficient tool for text summarization.
- Enhance user productivity by reducing the time required to digest large volumes of text.
- Demonstrate the capabilities of NLTK and NLP techniques in text processing tasks.

## Expected Outcomes:
The project is expected to deliver a user-friendly application capable of accurately summarizing text documents, thereby aiding users in extracting crucial information efficiently.

## Timeline:
- Planning and Research: 1 week
- Development and Testing: 3 weeks
- User Feedback and Iterations: 1 week
- Finalization and Deployment: 1 week

## Budget:
The project budget primarily consists of developer time and potential costs associated with hosting the application. As it utilizes open-source libraries and frameworks, the budget remains modest.

## Team Members:
- Rishabh Tanpure: Developer, responsible for project implementation and maintenance.

This project aims to streamline the process of digesting textual information, offering users a valuable tool for text summarization tasks.
